 Given two strings, base and remove, return a version of 
 the base string where all instances of the remove string 
 have been removed (not case sensitive). You may assume that 
 the remove string is length 1 or more. Remove only 
 non-overlapping instances, so with "xxx" removing "xx" 
 leaves "x".

 withoutString("Hello there", "llo") → "He there"
 withoutString("Hello there", "e") → "Hllo thr"
 withoutString("Hello there", "x") → "Hello there" **/

public String withoutString(String base, String remove) {
  //remove = remove.toLowerCase();
  //return base.replace(remove, ""); not case sensitive
    return base.replaceAll("(?i)" + remove, ""); //String#replaceAll(String, String) with case insensitive regex.

}
