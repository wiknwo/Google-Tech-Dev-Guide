# Former Coding Interview Question: Compression and 
# Decompression
# 
# In this exercise, you're going to decompress a compressed 
# string. Your input is a compressed string of the format 
# number[string] and the decompressed output form should be 
# the string written number times. For example: The input
# 3[abc]4[ab]c Would be output as abcabcabcababababc
# 
# - Number can have more than one digit. For example, 
#   10[a] is allowed, and just means aaaaaaaaaa
#
# - One repetition can occur inside another. For example, 
#   2[3[a]b] decompresses into aaabaaab
#
# - Characters allowed as input include digits, small 
#   English letters and brackets [ ]. 
# 
# - Digits are only to represent amount of repetitions.
#
# - Letters are just letters.
#
# - Brackets are only part of syntax of writing repeated 
#   substring.
#
# - Input is always valid, so no need to check its validity.
